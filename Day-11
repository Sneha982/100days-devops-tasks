Day 11: Install and Configure Tomcat Server
The Nautilus application development team recently finished the beta version of one of their Java-based applications, which they are planning to deploy on one of the app servers in Stratos DC. After an internal team meeting, they have decided to use the tomcat application server. Based on the requirements mentioned below complete the task:

a. Install tomcat server on App Server 3.
b. Configure it to run on port 5001.
c. There is a ROOT.war file on Jump host at location /tmp.
Deploy it on this tomcat server and make sure the webpage works directly on base URL i.e curl http://stapp03:5001

Details:

App Server 3 â†’ stapp03
IP: 172.16.238.12
Hostname: stapp03.stratos.xfusioncorp.com
SSH User: banner
Solution:

Copy the ROOT.war file from the jump host to the target server:

scp /tmp/ROOT.war banner@stapp03:/tmp
SSH into the App Server 3 and gain root privileges:

ssh banner@stapp03
sudo -i
Install Tomcat and configure the service port to 5001:

yum install -y tomcat
vi /usr/share/tomcat/conf/server.xml  # Update 8080 to 5001
Deploy the ROOT.war file:

cp /tmp/ROOT.war /usr/share/tomcat/webapps/
ls -la /usr/share/tomcat/webapps/
Start and enable the Tomcat service:

systemctl start tomcat
systemctl enable tomcat
This ensures that the Tomcat server runs on boot and the application is deployed properly.

Verify:
Run the following command from any host that can access stapp03:

curl -i http://stapp03:5001
This checks that the web application is accessible and responds with HTTP 200.

Result:

HTTP/1.1 200 
Accept-Ranges: bytes
ETag: W/"471-1580289830000"
