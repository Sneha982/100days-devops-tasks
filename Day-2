Creating a User with an Expiry Date:

Create a user named kareem on App Server 2 in Stratos Datacenter. Set the expiry date to 2024-03-28, ensuring the user is created in lowercase as per standard protocol.

Note: You can find the infrastructure details by clicking on the Details of all Users and Servers button on the top-right section of the page.


Why Set a User Expiry Date?
An account expiry date is a security control that automatically disables a user after a specific date.
This is useful for:

Temporary staff or contractors
Project-based accounts
Accounts created for audits, testing, or training
It saves you from having to remember to manually disable accounts, and it reduces the risk of unused accounts being exploited. A perfect use case is giving a contract developer SSH access only until the project deadline — once the expiry date passes, the account is locked automatically.
