Day 1: Creating a User with a Non-Interactive Shell

What is a Non-Interactive Shell?
A non-interactive shell is a shell that does not allow the user to log in and interact directly with the system. It is often used as a security measure for accounts that are meant to run background tasks or automated processes, but not for humans to log in.

Terraform AWS User with no console access, can run automation but no one can log in to the console with the credentials
