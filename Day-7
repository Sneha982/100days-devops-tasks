Linux SSH Authentication

Set up password-less authentication from thor on the jump host to all app servers via their respective sudo users.

What is password-less SSH?
Password-less SSH uses public/private key pairs instead of typing a password every time you connect to a server. I

Enables automation (scripts, cron jobs) without manual password entry
Improves security, as private keys are harder to brute-force than passwords
Helps with consistency when managing multiple servers
Steps taken to carry out the task
1Ô∏è. I made sure I was connected to the jump host ‚Äòthor‚Äô


2Ô∏è. Generated SSH key pair for thor

ssh-keygen -t rsa
Pressed Enter to accept default file location (~/.ssh/id_rsa).
Left the passphrase empty to allow full automation.

The keys were saved to
~/.ssh/id_rsa    # Private key (keep safe)
~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub  # Public key
Press enter or click to view image in full size

3Ô∏è. Copied the public key to each app server‚Äôs sudo user

For App Server 1 (tony):

#For App Server 1 (tony):
ssh-copy-id tony@<app_server1_ip>

#For App Server 2 (steve):
ssh-copy-id steve@<app_server2_ip>

#For App Server 3 (banner):
ssh-copy-id banner@<app_server3_ip>
üí° Note: Entered each user‚Äôs password once during this step. After that, no password was needed

4. Tested password-less login to each app server

ssh tony@<app_server1_ip>
ssh steve@<app_server2_ip>
ssh banner@<app_server3_ip>
Each connection succeeded without prompting for a password.

5. As best practice, protected my private key with:

chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa
chmod (short for change mode) is a Linux command used to change a file‚Äôs permissions.

6 Owner can read (4) + write (2) = 6
0 ‚ÜíGroup has no permissions
0 Others have no permissions
This ensures only the owner can read the key. Without this, other users on the same system could copy the key and gain access.

Key Takeaways

SSH key-based authentication improves automation and security.
ssh-copy-id is the fastest way to configure the authentication
Always secure your private key with chmod 600 in real-world setups.
